# The-Scriptwriter
Stories are structured causalities. Strings of words form pages of sentences, recalling a past, painting a thought or envisioning a future. The Scriptwriter is an exploration into such microfiction narratives. As you turn the knob, sentences change, new meaning emerges and new scripts are created.
